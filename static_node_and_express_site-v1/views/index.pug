      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      each project in projects

        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text

          a(href=`projects/${project.id}`)
            img.thumbnail(src= `${project.image_urls[3]}`, alt=`${project.image_urls[0].slice(40, -4)}`)
